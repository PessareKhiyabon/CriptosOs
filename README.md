# Installing And Usage !

Markdown-Diff annotates word [diff][]s of [Markdown][] documents for easier review.
It reformats the output of [`wdiff`][] or `git --word-diff` in Markdown, so the changes to a Markdown document can be viewed inline.
It can also summarize commit history of Markdown documents in a Git repository as well as the changes made to them.
